# The Last of Websites

Welcome to *The Last of Websites*, a heartfelt tribute to the official websites of *The Last of Us* as they appeared in 2013/2014.

This project is a recreation of these iconic sites, lovingly pieced together using artifacts from the [Web Archive](http://web.archive.org). While much has been restored, some assets are still missing to achieve a truly faithful recreation. If you happen to have any of the missing assets listed below, your contributions are highly welcome! Please consider submitting a PR (pull request) or reaching out to me directly. Together, we can preserve this unique slice of gaming history.
